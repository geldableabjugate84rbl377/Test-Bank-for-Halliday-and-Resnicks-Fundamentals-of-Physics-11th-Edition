  * A two-volume edition to engage students in understanding concepts and problem-solving Volume 1 of the Fundamentals of Physics, 11th Edition helps students embark on an understanding of physics. This loose-leaf text covers measurement, vectors, motion, and force. It also discusses energy, rotation, equilibrium, gravitation and oscillations. The First and Second Law of Thermodynamics are presented, as is the Kinetic Theory of Gases. Volume 2 looks at topics that include electric and magnetic fields; current and resistance; electromagnetic waves; and induction. Maxwell's Equations, Gauss's Law and Coulomb's Law are examined. Text problems and questions guide students in improving their problem-solving skills.
